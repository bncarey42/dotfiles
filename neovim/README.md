# Neovim

My custom config for neovim. Built primarily arround the Lazy package manage following the following tutorial ([Neovim Lazy Lua IDE - my simple but powerful setup for 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljhZ0e9zGE)) with minimal deviation. More customization as I grow more comfortable in the environment.

## Neovim Install

>TODO

## Use

### Option 1 (tested)

1. Clone this repo
2. Copy the contents of this directory to `~/.config/nvim`

### Option 2 (idea I've had litterally while typing this - VERY UNTESTED)

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a link from `~/.config/nvim` to this directory wherever you cloned it to

This __*should*__ allow for a more managed setup if you're working across multiple systems
